# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. It serves as a learning resource and reference for common computer science concepts.

## Current Implementations

### Data Structures

- **Linked List**: A flexible implementation that can store multiple data types (`linked_list.py`)
- **Binary Search**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm (`binary-search.py`)

### Features

- Clean and documented code
- Example usage for each implementation
- Support for multiple data types
- Educational comments explaining concepts

## Usage

Each file can be run independently to see examples:

```bash
# Run linked list example
python3 linked_list.py

# Run binary search example
python3 binary-search.py
```

## Contributing

Feel free to add more data structures and algorithms or improve the existing implementations.
