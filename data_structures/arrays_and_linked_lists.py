# Arrays are a collection of elements stored in a contiguous block of memory
# The elements are stored in a linear order
# The elements are accessed using an index

# The time complexity of accessing an element in an array is O(1)
# The time complexity of inserting an element in an array is O(n)
# The time complexity of deleting an element in an array is O(n)


# Linked lists are a collection of elements stored in a non-contiguous block of memory
# Each element is a node that contains a value and a pointer to the next node
# The elements are not stored in a linear order
# The elements are accessed using a pointer

# The time complexity of accessing an element in a linked list is O(n)
# The time complexity of inserting an element in a linked list is O(1)
# The time complexity of deleting an element in a linked list is O(1)


# Arrays vs Linked lists:
# Arrays are more efficient than linked lists when it comes to accessing elements
# Arrays are less efficient than linked lists when it comes to inserting and deleting elements

# Linked lists are more efficient than arrays when it comes to inserting and deleting elements
# Linked lists are less efficient than arrays when it comes to accessing elements
